# Stellarium-mobile

I publish the new fixed android version here.

https://github.com/ultrapre/Stellarium-android



It have many features basing on stellarium PC.


## Android feature:

- [x] DSS layer!



- [x] update comets by clicking once.



- [x] Telrad circle for easy use.



About the stars and DSO, I think they are enough for us to use.
